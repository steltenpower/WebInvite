# WeThread

Concretizing my toot "Inboxes are technically 'infinite', but humans do (roughly) 1 thing at a time, at 1 location at a time. While faces&places (much more bandwidth than scr+cam+keyb) are very important in structuring our thoughts and memories and sense of time (and belonging), a range of applications (and vendors deciding on data models and UX) scatter what we plan, travel, do, communicate, document, and log in systems or uncreative office spaces. Reply with ideas for putting our TIME and usability really central?"

So our lives are a thread, WEaved together. Planning, traveling, administration should not be scattered over apps. The agenda-like thing should be central, with your data in your own SoLid pod, that other apps can request partial access to. The thread goes through space and subjects, where visuals are an important aspect. Today there are already "Reply by meeting" and invites instead of "save the date"-mails. Also schedule everything upfront, not only 'me time', but also as an organisation don't tell your people to make X hours (on task or vacation) before deadline Y, but already put them in, for you to easily shuffle (within constraints, I mean suggestions). 

Also many of the time-based systems conflict in models, data, or how we think we understand them. Do you really understand how rules on all the different types of leave interact? And what if you add traveling? Expenses? 

Time is not money, time is not cost, time is value. Time is limited, don't overload yourself postponing what or who you love.

browser extension to enrich every mention of date+time with a "add to your agenda"-button.

Because "SAVE THE DATE" messages are evil without a 1-click-action to put it into my agenda (tentatively)

Please tell me it exists and where I can find it.
